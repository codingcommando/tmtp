***** For Linux *****

1. == Get the tmtp source code ==

To get the source, do the following:

$ git clone git@github.com:sconklin/tmtp.git

2. == Get the required pySVG python library ==

From this page:

http://code.google.com/p/pysvg/downloads/list

Download the file pysvg-0.2.1.zip

Unzip it and install it:

$ unzip pysvg-0.2.1.zip
$ cd pysvg-0.2.1/
$ sudo python setup.py install

3. == Test it ==

$ cd ../tmtp/standalone/tests
$ ./run-layout-test.sh

If this completes without error, everything is probably good.
You can look at the output file, layout-test.svg to see what it
looks like (it's boring, it's just a test pattern)
