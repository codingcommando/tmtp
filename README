The tmtp project supports open fashion design by allowing designers to create pattern design files that are adjusted to fit individual measurements, and generate SVG output for printing.

Initial development was done as an inkscape plugin.

Continuing work is taking place on a 'standalone' application called mkpattern, which runs on the command line and uses a pattern design file and client measurements to generate pattern output.

The application is free software, but designers who create pattern designs may use any license they wish for their designs.

The application is being developed using python and pysvg.
